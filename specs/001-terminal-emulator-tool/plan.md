# Implementation Plan: Terminal Emulator

**Branch**: `001-terminal-emulator-tool` | **Date**: 2025-10-07 | **Spec**: /specs/001-terminal-emulator-tool/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-terminal-emulator-tool/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```plain
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Configure Ghostty terminal emulator with Catppuccin color scheme, JetBrains Mono font, and settings for low-latency rendering and tmux/Zellij integration. Update to latest release version.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: N/A (configuration files)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Ghostty  
**Storage**: N/A  
**Testing**: Manual render tests  
**Target Platform**: macOS
**Project Type**: Single project (dotfiles)  
**Performance Goals**: Low-latency rendering  
**Constraints**: Config-as-code, no GUI-only settings  
**Scale/Scope**: Personal development environment

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Clean Configuration: Config lives in dotfiles, minimal and clean.
- Secure Defaults: Ensure secure settings.
- Centralization: All in this repo.
- Version Control Integration: Simple commit/push.
- Consistency: Consistent across configs.

### Source Code (repository root)

```

```

**Structure Decision**: Single config file in ghostty/ directory, following dotfiles structure.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research Ghostty configuration options for performance.
   - Research latest Ghostty release and update process.
   - Research tmux/Zellij keybinding compatibility.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for terminal emulator configuration"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for Ghostty in development environment"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - No data entities, configuration settings.

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - No APIs, configuration contracts.

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Manual validation tests.

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Render test scenarios.

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each validation scenario → test task
- Configuration setup → implementation task

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Setup config first, then validate.

**Estimated Output**: 5-10 tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
|  |  |  |

## Progress Tracking

*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
