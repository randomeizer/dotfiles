# Feature Specification: Terminal Emulator

**Feature Branch**: `001-terminal-emulator-tool`  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Terminal Emulator

Tool Options: Ghostty

Goal
Fast, minimal terminal with config-as-code and reliable tmux/Zellij support.

Success Criteria
  ‚Ä¢ Config lives in dotfiles; no GUI-only settings.
  ‚Ä¢ Truecolor, ligatures, sixel/kitty-graphics as needed.
  ‚Ä¢ Low-latency rendering; stable under heavy multiplexing.

Key Decisions
  ‚Ä¢ Color scheme: Catppuccin (Mocha).
  ‚Ä¢ Leave translucent background config commented out.
  ‚Ä¢ Font: JetBrains Mono.

Config/Setup
  ‚Ä¢ Ghostty: ~/.config/ghostty/config
  ‚Ä¢ Font family/size, padding, cursor, keymap passthrough for tmux.
  ‚Ä¢ Use `stow` to install/manage configuration files.

Integration/Dependencies
  ‚Ä¢ Plays nice with tmux/Zellij (no keybinding collisions).
  ‚Ä¢ Respects $SHELL (nushell/zsh/fish).

Risks/Trade-offs
  ‚Ä¢ Ghostty is evolving quickly; update to the latest release version.

Validation
  ‚Ä¢ Render test: truecolor check; emoji/nerd fonts; split panes; input latency."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07

- Q: Tool options? ‚Üí A: Drop WezTerm, stick with Ghostty only.
- Q: Version policy for Ghostty? ‚Üí A: Update to the latest release version.
- Q: How to install/manage config files? ‚Üí A: Use `stow`.
- Q: Translucent background configuration? ‚Üí A: Leave in config but commented out.

## Execution Flow (main)

```plain
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a developer, I want to configure a fast, minimal terminal emulator with config-as-code and reliable tmux/Zellij support to efficiently manage my development environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a development environment, **When** I configure the terminal, **Then** it supports truecolor, ligatures, and low-latency rendering.
2. **Given** tmux/Zellij usage, **When** I use the terminal, **Then** there are no keybinding collisions and it remains stable under heavy multiplexing.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Ghostty evolves quickly? Update to the latest release version.
- How does it handle different shells? Respects $SHELL (nushell/zsh/fish).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Terminal MUST support config-as-code, living in dotfiles without GUI-only settings.
- **FR-002**: Terminal MUST support truecolor, ligatures, sixel/kitty-graphics as needed.
- **FR-003**: Terminal MUST provide low-latency rendering and stability under heavy multiplexing.
- **FR-004**: Terminal MUST integrate with tmux/Zellij without keybinding collisions.
- **FR-005**: Terminal MUST respect $SHELL (nushell/zsh/fish).
